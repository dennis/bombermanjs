bombermanjs
===========

A small hello world project as a testcase for learning more about javascript.
Originally written using NodeJS/Socket.io which is now removed to avoid dealing
with all sort of network related (game) issues. The game works, but is no fun.

* Code: @dennis
* Graphics: Original Bomb Party sprite sheet by Matt Hackett of Lost Decade Games, expanded by Cem Kalyoncu and /usr/share. Found at [opengameart](http://opengameart.org/content/bomb-party-the-complete-set). Added a few tiles (mirrored bomberman animation) to avoid doing that runetime.
* Sfx: [Step](http://freesound.org/people/RandomationPictures/sounds/138476/), [Explosion](http://freesound.org/people/sarge4267/sounds/102733/), [Start](http://freesound.org/people/Eelke/sounds/96514/), [GameOver](http://freesound.org/people/kirbydx/sounds/175409/)

History
=======
* v0.2 : Change it into a browser-only "game". Added sfx, boxes to blow up. Bombs explodes if they're hit by flames from other bombs. "Sherry The Terrorist" walks left and commits suicide when she can go left no more. Still no fun :)
* v0.1 : Functional "game"
